# QubitAnimations
Interactive javascript animations of quantum state maps of 1-qubit pure and mixed states (on a "Bloch Circle"), 2-qubit separable states (on a torus), and 2-qubit entangled states (on an annular torroid).
Animations are designed to assist with learning basic concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum computation.
Background information on these qubit maps, including images and examples of how they can be used, are found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03448 ; paper preprint also in this directory.  Formulas used to create the maps are found in the appendices to this paper. 
# Installation
html files for each animation are contained in the singleAnimation directory.  Other directories contain supporting javascript files.
