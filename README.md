# QubitAnimations
Live at [quantum.bard.edu](http://quantum.bard.edu): Interactive javascript animations of quantum state maps of 1-qubit pure and mixed states (on a "Bloch Circle"), 2-qubit separable states (on a torus), and 2-qubit entangled states (on an annular torroid).
Animations are designed to assist with learning basic concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum computation.
Background information on these qubit maps, including images and examples of how they can be used, are found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03448 ; this paper preprint, Qubit_Animations.pdf, is also in this repository.  Formulas used to create the maps are found in the appendices of this paper. 

# Installation
html files for each animation are contained in the `singleAnimation/` directory.  Other directories contain supporting javascript files. Run a live server on the root directory `/` to see the animations locally. This is important for the javascript imports to work.


# MISC 

## Python
`prototype/` has prototype visualizations in python notebook that involve less code and are easier to modify. The version of packages used are:
- Python 3.8.3
- qutip 4.5.0
- matplotlib 3.1.3
- numpy 1.18.1
